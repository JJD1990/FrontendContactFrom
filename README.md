# FrontendContactForm
1: Created the bootstrap forms within the accordion - added ids to enable getElementById through javascript so that I can allocate the data to the right elements. Also created phone input verification with regex. 2: Wrote the functons which will both render the data into the correct elements and show the forms once a select/option has been chosen. 2a: Initially struggled to get access to the data.json file so had to remind myself of the need to add a config to make the data available to be rendered. 2b: Did not want to run out of time so within the generateData function I could have used a loop, probably a for/of loop, rather than manually repeating the code to render the data, however I wasnt sure if the loop would have selected the right elements so went for the manual option. 3: Added simple styles to the accordion and buttons, trying to match the CMO Group branding, not steal focus and make sure the form could fit anywhere on any website without looking out of place.
